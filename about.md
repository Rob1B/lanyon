I'm Robin Bertin. I'm a junior engine developer at Asobo Studio, in Bordeaux, France. I'm currently working on Microsoft Flight Simulator.

My subject is mainly graphical APIs related. I worked on DX12 memory allocation, resources management and everything that is performance related.

I enjoy everything that is low level : OS, compilation, memory etc. But also things that are graphics such as 3D. Currently I'm trying to understand
Linux graphics stack and GPU driver development and I also continue my little proto of a Rust game engine (just the beginning).

When I'm not on development stuff, I like playing video games (not original I known) like Final Fantasy XIV or League Of Legends. I'm also a fantasy and SF enjoyer and a drummer.
