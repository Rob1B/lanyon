## School projects

### oVRseer

As part of the courses [Advanced Graphics and Interactions](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/DH2413?l=en) at KTH, we had to develop (with a team of 5) a game that use combination of advanced graphics (for student) and interactions.

oVRseer is a multiplayer adversarial asymmetric game. The oVRseer is a VR player that need to look for tiny golems in order to kill them by throwing them into a lava pit. The tiny players are computer players that need to find keys and espace through a portal as soon as all the keys are retrieved.

The game is developped under Unity. I was the main network developper during this project. We used Mirror as a high level library for networking. I also created the UI, the ending and spectator system and an integration with Vivox in order to have a ingame voice chat.
